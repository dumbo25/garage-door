#   Most systems have many certs. So, name your cert appropriately (cert.key is a poor
#   choice). As an example, my $HOSTNAME for a smart Raspberry Pi garage door opener is
#   garageopener, and a descriptive name for the cert might be garage-opener.  I chose
#   to use garage-opener where ♣certname♣ appears below.
