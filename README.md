Code for a smart garage door opener. Features:
  * Open and close an overhead garage door 
  ** replace doorbell button with this device
  ** use a 3V remote for the opener - works with any garage door
  * Camera with motion eye to monitor garage
  * Seco-larm to sense if the garage door is opened or closed
  * Control the garage door from a SmartPhone (e.g., Android or iPhone) 
  * Control the garage door through an Amazon Echo
  * Monitor and record the state of the garage door 
  * Access monitoring data over the internet or through Echo
  * Keep the garage door secure (e.g., on power loss, the door should not open, no one else on the web can open the door)
  * Do not allow anyone else on the net to open the door (two way self-signed SSL certificate)
  * Set a schedule for when the garage door should be opened or closed (time of day, vacation, no one home)
  * Send a text message to open or more smart phones if the door is open when it should be closed
  * Command-line scripts to open, close and return the status of the garage door
