This repository contains the code for a wall-mounted, smart garage door opener, as well as, older versions of the project. 

The wall mounted device replaces the garage doorbell button.

The features of the recommended version includes:
 * Open and close an overhead garage door using:
     * Blue pushbutton, which replaces the doorbell button
     * SmartPhone (e.g., Android or iPhone) 
     * Amazon Echo
 * A 3V remote for the openeris electrically pressed. So, it works with RPi0 and any garage door opener
 * Camera with motion eye to monitor garage
 * Seco-larm to monitor and record if the garage door is opened or closed
 * Access monitoring data over the internet or through Echo
 * Keep the garage door secure (e.g., on power loss, the door should not open, no one else on the web can open the door)
 * Do not allow anyone else on the net to open the door (two way self-signed SSL certificate)
 * Set a schedule for when the garage door should be opened or closed (time of day, vacation, no one home)
 * Send a text message to one or more smart phones if the door is open when it should be closed
 * Command-line scripts to open, close and return the status of the garage door
